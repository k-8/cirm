Use Emma's genes to restrict Nomura's  (restrict the set of
Nomura's genes we apply LASSO to.)  Reason is that say
A1BG is highly correlated with A1CF.  But Emma's set doesnt
have A1BG.  So, looking at Nomura's data which has both A1BG
and A1CF, Lasso by bad luck decides to send A1CF coefficient
to 0 and use A1BG as the representor of the two - returning a
coefficient of .3 for A1BG and 0 for A1CF.
Then when we apply the model to Emma's data with predict(),
Emma's data only has A1CF.  It says "Okay according to the best
model we could get, A1CF is irrelevant, so.."  which is really
a bad conclusion since Emma's data DOES have basically all the
information provided by A1BG (in the form of A1CF)
