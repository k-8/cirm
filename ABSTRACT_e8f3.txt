Monte data set:
32800 genes
55 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
29 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
29 control
iPS -> cardiomyocytes
# humans = 100

MXM on Emma:  questionable

Google  "hypertrophic cardiomyocyte data"
=> S Nomura 2018
GSE 95140 md5=b7cd

Patients are actually DCM!  Oh well

--------------------
MXM on Nomura:  okay

a=read.table("C:/users/robertkam/desktop/Nomura_b7cd.txt",header=T,row.names=1)
dim(a)  #23355 x 559

Dilated = as.integer(substr(colnames(a),1,4)=='DCM_')

cbind(colnames(a)[440:450],Dilated[440:450])
#looks good

a2 = t(a)
a2 = log10(1+a2)

Nomura =x=>    Emma
       (Lasso)

Note Nomura is pure cardiomyocytes:  "isolated rod shaped cells"
Emma's is also pure cardiomyocytes.

DECIDE:  Is there is a material difference between
         *ipsc-derived* cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes obtained from
         a heart?

Google  "dilated cardiomyopathy cardiomyocyte rna seq"

ME Sweet 2018 - 37 DCM patients

M Heinig 2017 - 97 DCM patients

There are no iPSC->cardiomyocytes w/DCM data sets.

Heinig (public EGAS) data is .bam and .fq (raw base pairs)
Go with Sweet.

Sweet =x=>    Nomura
      (Lasso)

Sweet =>      Nomura
      (DEGs)

Lasso is not an automatic solution to finding a set of ~15 predictor
genes to distinguish DCM vs. Control etc.

Sweet =x=>    Emma
      (DEGs)

general cardiomyocyte DEGs => Emma.

PROVED:  ipsc-derived cardiomyocytes are distinct from those
         from a heart.
